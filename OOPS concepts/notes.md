- Abstraction:
Hides complex logic and shows only essential features using functions, classes, or modules.
- Encapsulation:
Bundles data and methods together while restricting direct access using closures or private class fields (# syntax).
- Inheritance:
Allows one class to acquire properties and methods of another using extends keyword.
- Polymorphism:
Lets methods behave differently based on the object, like method overriding in child classes.
